            We are 4th year students at the information system department of Ben-Gurion university. <br/>
            we build this web application using angularjs, javascript, jquery, HTML5 and css as well. <br/>
            Working on this project was very enjoyable. <br/>
            The main challenge during the work was in collecting all the data, </br>
            and training the neural network. <br/>
        <br/><br/>
